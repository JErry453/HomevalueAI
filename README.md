## Overview

This project involves analyzing real estate pricing data for properties in the Delhi NCR region. The dataset includes information on property prices, addresses, area, number of bedrooms, and price per square foot. The aim is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data to uncover insights and trends in the real estate market.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is `Delhi_v2.csv` and contains the following columns:

- `price`: The price of the property.
- `Address`: The location of the property.
- `area`: The area of the property in square feet.
- `Bedrooms`: The number of bedrooms in the property.
- `Price_sqft`: The price per square foot of the property.

The dataset has a total of 7738 entries with 18 columns. Key columns include property price, address, area, number of bedrooms, and price per square foot.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The following steps were performed in data cleaning and preprocessing:

1. **Loading Data**: The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Initial Exploration**: The dataset was explored to understand its structure and content.
3. **Missing Values**: Columns with significant missing values were dropped.
4. **Column Removal**: Unnecessary columns were removed for streamlined analysis.
5. **Address Normalization**: Addresses were standardized by grouping less frequent addresses into an 'Other' category.

## Feature Engineering

- **Address Simplification**: Addresses with fewer than 10 occurrences were grouped into the 'Other' category.
- **Price per Square Foot Calculation**: Price per square foot was retained for further analysis.

## Outlier Removal

Outliers were identified and removed based on the ratio of `area` to `Bedrooms`. Properties where this ratio was less than 300 were considered outliers and removed from the dataset.

   ```bash
